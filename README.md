# AIBS NODDI
This projects correlates regional gene expression with NODDI features in healthy controls.
By replacing the NODDI maps with any other brain map in MNI space, this is a fairly generic
application.

The statistcs is based on rank correlation, but adjusted for spatial autocorrelation.

It is recommended to run the analyis per brain donor and to combine the results for individual genes
using META analysis.
